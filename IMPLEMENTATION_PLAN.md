# Implementation Plan

This plan is promoted from the `auto steward --report-only` pass that ran on
2026-06-03 against `main`. Source of truth for the promoted rows is
`/tmp/robopoker-steward-9283/{DRIFT,HAZARDS,HINGES,PROMOTIONS,RETIRE,STEWARDSHIP-REPORT}.md`.

`auto parallel` consumes this file. Each item has an owner set, a scope
boundary, acceptance criteria, verification commands, dependencies, and a
completion signal so a worker can claim and finish it without re-discovering
context.

## Active items (worker-ready)

- [x] `STW-003` Restore database-backed server/gameroom build.
  Owner files: `crates/gameroom/Cargo.toml`, `crates/gameroom/src/players/database.rs`,
  `crates/gameroom/src/players/realtime.rs`, `crates/gameroom/src/players/zerotemp.rs`,
  `crates/server/Cargo.toml`, `bin/backend/Cargo.toml`.
  Scope boundary: make `cargo check -p rbp-server`, `cargo check -p rbp-gameroom --features database`,
  and `cargo check -p backend` compile without weakening database-backed player behavior;
  do not redesign room protocol or training.
  Acceptance criteria: the database-backed players construct a `Flagship` through a real
  `Hydrate` impl that is selected by the same feature chain as the gameroom database feature;
  no `#[allow(dead_code)]` or feature-flag disablement used to silence the failure.
  Verification commands:
  `cargo check -p rbp-server`,
  `cargo check -p rbp-gameroom --features database`,
  `cargo check -p backend`,
  `cargo check --workspace`,
  `cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=4`.
  Required tests: existing workspace tests; the new chain must not break `cargo check --workspace`.
  Dependencies: none.
  Estimated scope: S.
  Completion signal: feature-specific server and gameroom checks are green.

- [ ] `STW-004` Harden auth secrets and session validation.
  Owner files: `crates/auth/src/crypto.rs`, `crates/auth/src/handlers.rs`,
  `crates/auth/src/middleware.rs`, `crates/auth/src/repository.rs`,
  `crates/auth/src/session.rs`, `crates/auth/Cargo.toml`.
  Scope boundary: validate `JWT_SECRET`, align stored session token hash with middleware
  checks, and add request-level tests; do not introduce OAuth, cookies, refresh tokens, or
  rate limiting in this slice.
  Acceptance criteria: missing or empty `JWT_SECRET` cannot silently create production
  tokens; login/register store a verifiable token/session binding; authenticated extractors
  reject revoked, expired, missing, malformed, and mismatched tokens.
  Verification commands:
  `cargo test -p rbp-auth --features server`,
  `cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=4`,
  `cargo check -p rbp-server` (after `STW-003`).
  Required tests: positive login/me flow, missing-secret behavior, invalid token, revoked
  session, token/session mismatch.
  Dependencies: `STW-003` only for full server check, not for `rbp-auth` crate tests.
  Estimated scope: M.
  Completion signal: `rbp-auth --features server` has meaningful passing tests and no
  empty-secret fallback remains.

- [ ] `STW-005` Restore workspace formatter gate.
  Owner files: every file reported by `cargo fmt --check` (auth, autotrain, cards,
  gameplay, gameroom, mccfr, nlhe, rbp, server).
  Scope boundary: run `cargo fmt` and commit only mechanical formatting changes; no
  behavior changes; do not reformat generated or vendored code.
  Acceptance criteria: `cargo fmt --check` exits 0 after the change.
  Verification commands:
  `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=4`.
  Required tests: existing workspace tests only.
  Dependencies: none.
  Estimated scope: S.
  Completion signal: formatter gate is green and the diff is purely mechanical.

## Deferred items (need operator decision before promotion)

- [!] `STW-001` Recreate executable planning surface.
  Owner files: `AGENTS.md`, future `genesis/`, future `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
  Blocker: `auto corpus` cannot run because `gbrain` is not configured in the
  operator environment (probe exits 1 with "No brain configured"). Operator must
  either init `gbrain` or hand-author a queue before this becomes claimable.

- [!] `STW-006` Classify and fix schema panic contracts.
  Owner files: `crates/autotrain/src/epoch.rs`, `crates/auth/src/member.rs`,
  `crates/auth/src/session.rs`, `crates/gameroom/src/room.rs`,
  `crates/gameroom/src/records/*.rs`, `crates/database/src/traits.rs`.
  Blocker: operator must decide whether the `Schema::copy` / `Schema::columns` /
  `Schema::indices` / `Schema::freeze` panics represent intentional unsupported
  derived-table operations or missing production implementations. Each one
  affects autotrain resumability, room/hand-history persistence safety, and
  database maintenance command safety.

- [!] `STW-007` Retire stale generated/local artifacts.
  Owner files: `.auto/corpus-staging/`, `.auto/logs/steward-*-prompt.md`,
  `.auto/tui*/`, `.auto/orchestrator/velocity-*`, `.gbrain-source`.
  Blocker: `.gbrain-source` is tracked; operator must sign off before deletion
  even though the rest are ignored.

## Promotion provenance

The rows above were promoted from
`/tmp/robopoker-steward-9283/PROMOTIONS.md` on 2026-06-03 as part of kanban
task `t_9283ea83`. The first promotion to land is `STW-003` (highest-priority
hinge, mainnet-blocking, user-facing).
